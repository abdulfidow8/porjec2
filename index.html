                  <h1>The Saimon Fish</h1>
                  <p>Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae.
                    Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native
                    to tributaries of the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. There are six types of salmon that
                    are harvested in and around the waters of North America. There is one salmon from the
                    Atlantic Ocean called the Atlantic Salmon, and five from the Pacific Ocean called Chinook,
                    Chum, Choho, Pink, Sockeye.</p>

                  <h1>The Pcific Halibut Fish</h1>
                  <p>There are many great destinations for halibut fishing in Alaska. While on the cruise, halibut
                     fishing is available in Juneau and Ketchikan. You can check the shore excursions offered by your
                     cruise line for fishing trips that coordinate with the ships port schedule. While on the land
                     portion of your trip, halibut fishing is available in Seward and Homer. Halibut is a milk,
                     sweet-tasting fish that is high in protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. The potato
                     chip-crust makes this baked halibut recipe especially appealing to kids.</p>

                  <h1>The magnificent Tuna Fish</h1>
                  <p>The yellowfin tuna is a species you'll find in canned tuna, and may be called Chunk Light tuna.
                     These tuna are often caught in a purse seine net, which faced an outcry in the U.S. for its
                     effects on dolphins, which are often associated with schools of tuna, and were therefore captured
                     along with the tuna, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of dolphins each year.
                     Recent improvements in the fishery have reduced the dolphin bycatch.
                     The yellowfin tuna often has a yellow stripe on its side, and its second dorsal fins and anal fins
                     are long and yellow. Their maximum length is 7.8 feet and weight is 440 pounds. Yellowfin tuna prefer
                     warmer, tropical to subtropical waters. This fish has a relatively short lifespan of 6-7 years.</p>
