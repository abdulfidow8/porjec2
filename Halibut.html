                  <h1>The Pcific Halibut Fish</h1>
                  <p>There are many great destinations for halibut fishing in Alaska. While on the cruise, halibut
                     fishing is available in Juneau and Ketchikan. You can check the shore excursions offered by your
                     cruise line for fishing trips that coordinate with the ships port schedule. While on the land
                     portion of your trip, halibut fishing is available in Seward and Homer. Halibut is a milk,
                     sweet-tasting fish that is high in protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. The potato
                     chip-crust makes this baked halibut recipe especially appealing to kids.</p>

                  <p>The Pacific halibut is the world's largest flatfish.[5] The IGFA record was apparently broken off
                     the waters of Norway in July 2013 by a 515-pound 8.6 foot fish. This is awaiting certification as
                     of 2013.[6] In July 2014, 76-year-old Jack McGuire caught a 482-pound Pacific halibut in Glacier Bay,
                     Alaska (this is, however, discounted from records because it was shot to prevent injury to those on the boat).[7]
                     Halibut are dark brown on the top side with an off-white underbelly and have very small scales invisible to the
                     naked eye embedded in their skin.[8] At birth, they have an eye on each side of the head, and swim like a salmon.
                     After six months, one eye migrates to the other side, making them look more like flounder. At the same time, the
                     stationary-eyed side darkens to match the top side, while the other side remains white. This color scheme disguises
                     halibut from above (blending with the ocean floor) and from below (blending into the light from the sky) and is known
                     as countershading.</p>
                  <p>Halibut feed on almost any fish or animal they can fit into their mouths. Juvenile halibut feed on small crustaceans
                    and other bottom-dwelling organisms. Animals found in their stomachs include sand lance, octopus, crab, salmon, hermit
                    crabs, lamprey, sculpin, cod, pollock, herring, and flounder, as well as other halibut. Halibut live at depths ranging
                    from a few meters to hundreds, and although they spend most of their time near the bottom,[1] halibut may move up in the
                    water column to feed. In most ecosystems, the halibut is near the top of the marine food chain. In the North Pacific,
                    common predators are sea lions, killer whales, salmon sharks and humans.</p>
                 <p>Filleting of Pacific halibut taken in Cook Inlet, Alaska. Each halibut yields four fillets; the yield percentage is higher
                   than for most types of fish. The North Pacific commercial halibut fishery dates to the late 19th century and today is one of
                   the region's largest and most lucrative. In Canadian and US waters, long-line fishing predominates, using chunks of octopus
                   ("devilfish") or other bait on circle hooks attached at regular intervals to a weighted line that can extend for several miles
                   across the bottom. The fishing vessel retrieves the line after several hours to a day. The effects of long-line gear on habitats
                   are poorly understood, but could include disturbance of sediments, benthic structures, and other structures. International management
                   is thought to be necessary, because the species occupies waters of the United States, Canada, Russia, and possibly Japan
                   (where the species is known to the Japanese as ohyo), and matures slowly. Halibut do not reproduce until age eight, when about
                   30 in (76 cm) long, so commercial capture below this length prevents breeding and is against US and Canadian regulations supporting
                   sustainability. Pacific halibut fishing is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission. For most of the modern era,
                   halibut fishery operated as a derby. Regulators declared time slots when fishing was open (typically 24–48 hours at a time) and
                   fisherman raced to catch as many pounds as they could within that interval. This approach accommodated unlimited participation in
                   the fishery while allowing regulators to control the quantity of fish caught annually by controlling the number and timing of openings.
                   The approach led to unsafe fishing, as openings were necessarily set before the weather was known, forcing fisherman to leave port
                   regardless of the weather. The approach limited fresh halibut to the markets to several weeks per year, when the gluts would push down
                   the price received by fishermen.[citation needed]</p>
                <p>In 1995, US regulators allocated individual fishing quotas (IFQs) to existing fishery participants based on each vessel's documented
                   historical catch. IFQs grant to holders a specific proportion of each year's total allowable catch (TAC). The fishing season is
                   nine months. The IFQ system improved both safety and product quality by providing a stable flow of fresh halibut to the marketplace.
                   Critics of the program suggest, since holders can sell their quota and the fish are a public resource, the IFQ system gave a public
                   resource to the private sector. The fisheries were managed through a treaty between the United States and Canada per recommendations
                   of the International Pacific Halibut Commission, formed in 1923. A significant sport fishery in Alaska and British Columbia has emerged,
                   where halibut are prized game and food fish. Sport fisherman use large rods and reels with 80–150 lb (36–68 kg) line, and often bait with
                   herring, large jigs, or whole salmon heads. Halibut are strong and fight strenuously when exposed to air. Smaller fish will usually be
                   pulled on board with a gaff and may be clubbed or even punched in the head to prevent them from thrashing around on the deck. In both
                   commercial and sport fisheries, standard procedure is to shoot or otherwise subdue very large halibut over 150–200 lb (68–91 kg) before
                   landing them. Alaska's sport fishery is an element of the state's tourism economy.</p>

                in Europe,Aisia, and Africa. Also in USA, I traved 48th Sates and I have seen most of the Cities. Now I am
                student at Galvenaze and I like to learn coding as much as I can. So far I have been nothing but fun. Because, I have a wonderful teachers and
                all Galvenaze staff are friendly therefore,I know I will do wonderful.</p>
