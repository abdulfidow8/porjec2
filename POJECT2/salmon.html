                  <h1>The Saimon Fish</h1>
                  <p>Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae.
                    Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native
                    to tributaries of the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. There are six types of salmon that
                    are harvested in and around the waters of North America. There is one salmon from the
                    Atlantic Ocean called the Atlantic Salmon, and five from the Pacific Ocean called Chinook,
                    Chum, Choho, Pink, Sockeye.</p>

                    <img src="Images/salmon.jpg" alt="salmon" class="img-responsive">

                    <p>Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch
                      into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical
                      stripes. The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming
                      smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are
                      easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.
                      The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a
                      portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry
                      becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.</p>

                      <p>The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open
                         ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature. The adult salmon then return
                         primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one and
                         four years at sea. (When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is
                         called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland.) Prior to spawning, depending on
                         the species, salmon undergo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like
                         teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).
                         All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.
                         Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against
                         strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho,
                         for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from
                         the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer
                         the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn,
                         when they are known as kelts. In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals
                         die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity. Between 2 and
                         4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those
                         species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning
                         mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%.)</p>

                         <h2>Ecology</h2>

                         <p>In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting
                           wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.[51] The bodies of salmon represent a
                           transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and
                           phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.</p>

                         <p>Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying
                           them into adjacent wooded areas. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces
                          and partially eaten carcasses. Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon
                          they harvest on the forest floor,[52][53] in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms
                          per hectare,[54] providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the
                          riparian woodlands. The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream
                          where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.</p>

              <p>My Name is Abul Fidow. I was born in East Afric, I like to travel. So, I traveled many countries
                in Europe,Aisia, and Africa. Also in USA, I traved 48th Sates and I have seen most of the Cities. Now I am
                student at Galvenaze and I like to learn coding as much as I can. So far I have been nothing but fun. Because, I have a wonderful teachers and
                all Galvenaze staff are friendly therefore,I know I will do wonderful.</p>
